## P01 - Fraction Class
### Victoria Heredia
### Description:
This program defines a Fraction class that supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and equality comparison for fractions. The program reads fraction operations from a file named data.txt and outputs the results of these operations.



### Files

|   #   | File             | Description                                        |
| :---: | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | [Main.cpp](./main.cpp)         | Main had the code to overload operations like +,-,*,/, and ==      |
|   2   | [data.txt](./data.txt)| It has fractions        |

### Instructions
Navigate to the directory where your `main.cpp` file is located. Use the `cd` command to change directories. Ensure that you have a file named `data.txt` in the same directory. This file should contain the fraction operations you want to perform. The format for each line should be: 
1/2 + 3/4
5/6 - 1/3
7/8 * 2/3
4/5 / 1/5
Compile the program with `g++ -o fraction_program main.cpp`. Run the program using `./main.cpp < data.txt`. Finally, review the output in the terminal.
