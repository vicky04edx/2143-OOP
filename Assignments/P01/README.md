## P01 - Fraction Class
### Victoria Heredia
### Description:
This program defines a Fraction class that supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and equality comparison for fractions. The program reads fraction operations from a file named data.txt and outputs the results of these operations.



### Files

|   #   | File             | Description                                        |
| :---: | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | [Main.cpp](./main.cpp)         | Main has the code to overload operations such as `+` `-` `*` `/` and `==`      |
|   2   | [data.txt](./data.txt)| It contains fractions operations       |

### Instructions
Navigate to the directory where your `main.cpp` file is located. Use the `cd` command to change directories. Ensure that you have a file named `data.txt` in the same directory. This file should contain the fraction operations you want to perform. Compile the program with `g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp -o main`. Run the program using `./main.cpp < data.txt`. Finally, review the output in the terminal.

- Example Command:
    `vh@Vickyslaptop:~/projects/2143-OOP/Assignments/P01$ ./main < data.txt`
